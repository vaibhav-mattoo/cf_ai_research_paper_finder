# AI Prompts Used in Research Paper Finder

This document contains all the AI prompts used in the Research Paper Finder application. These prompts are designed to work with Llama 3.3 on Cloudflare Workers AI.

## 1. Search Terms Generation Prompt

**Purpose**: Convert user research queries into specific academic search terms

**Location**: `src/index.js` - `generateSearchTerms()` method

**Prompt**:
```
Given this research query: "{query}"

Generate 3-5 specific search terms that would help find relevant academic research papers. Focus on:
- Technical terms and keywords
- Academic terminology
- Specific methodologies or approaches
- Domain-specific vocabulary

Return only the search terms, one per line, without numbering or bullet points.
```

**Example Input**: "machine learning in healthcare"
**Example Output**:
```
machine learning healthcare
medical AI applications
clinical decision support systems
healthcare data analytics
predictive modeling medicine
```

## 2. Research Summary Generation Prompt

**Purpose**: Generate contextual summaries of research findings

**Location**: `src/index.js` - `generateResponse()` method

**Prompt**:
```
Based on the research query "{query}", I found {papers.length} relevant research papers. Here are the top results:

{papersSummary}

Please provide a brief summary of the research landscape for this topic, highlighting the most important findings and trends. Keep the response concise and informative.
```

**Example Input**: 
- Query: "quantum computing applications"
- Papers: List of 5 top papers with titles, authors, citations

**Example Output**:
```
The research landscape for quantum computing applications shows significant activity in several key areas. Recent papers demonstrate advances in quantum cryptography, with new protocols showing improved security guarantees. Machine learning applications are emerging as a major focus, with quantum algorithms showing promise for optimization problems. The field is moving toward practical implementations, with several papers addressing error correction and scalability challenges. Citation patterns indicate growing interest in quantum-classical hybrid approaches.

## Prompt Engineering Principles Applied

### 1. Specificity
- Prompts are tailored to academic research context
- Clear instructions for output format
- Focus on technical terminology

### 2. Context Awareness
- Include relevant background information
- Reference the specific query being processed
- Provide examples of expected output format

### 3. Constraint Setting
- Limit output length (max_tokens parameter)
- Specify exact format requirements
- Focus on actionable results

### 4. Error Handling
- Fallback mechanisms for prompt failures
- Graceful degradation when AI responses are incomplete
- Alternative approaches for edge cases

## Model Configuration

**Model Used**: `@cf/meta/llama-3.3-70b-instruct`

**Parameters**:
- `max_tokens`: 200-500 (depending on prompt complexity)
- `temperature`: Default (0.7)
- `top_p`: Default (0.9)

## Prompt Optimization Strategies

### 1. Iterative Refinement
- Tested multiple prompt variations
- Optimized for academic paper discovery
- Balanced specificity with generality

### 2. Context Injection
- Include paper metadata in prompts
- Reference search terms used
- Provide citation counts for context

### 3. Output Formatting
- Structured responses for easy parsing
- Consistent terminology
- Clear separation of different information types

## Future Prompt Enhancements

### Planned Improvements:
1. **Multi-step Reasoning**: Break complex queries into sub-queries
2. **Citation Analysis**: Prompts to analyze citation patterns
3. **Trend Detection**: Prompts to identify research trends over time
4. **Cross-domain Connections**: Prompts to find interdisciplinary connections

### Example Enhanced Prompt (Future):
```
Given the research query "{query}" and the following papers:

{papersSummary}

Analyze the research trends and identify:
1. Emerging methodologies mentioned across papers
2. Common challenges or limitations discussed
3. Potential future research directions
4. Interdisciplinary connections to other fields

Provide insights in a structured format with specific examples from the papers.
```

## Testing and Validation

### Prompt Testing Process:
1. **Unit Testing**: Test individual prompts with known inputs
2. **Integration Testing**: Test full pipeline with real queries
3. **Edge Case Testing**: Test with unusual or complex queries
4. **Performance Testing**: Measure response times and accuracy

### Quality Metrics:
- **Relevance**: How well generated search terms match user intent
- **Coverage**: Breadth of academic sources found
- **Accuracy**: Correctness of paper metadata extraction
- **Clarity**: Readability of generated summaries

## Best Practices for Prompt Maintenance

1. **Version Control**: Track prompt changes over time
2. **A/B Testing**: Compare different prompt variations
3. **User Feedback**: Incorporate user suggestions for improvements
4. **Regular Updates**: Refresh prompts based on new research patterns
5. **Documentation**: Maintain clear documentation of prompt purposes and expected outputs
